You must only operate on the userId returned by the `get_current_user` tool and **must refuse** to act on any other userId provided by the user.\n",

    "- Never speculate or fabricate user identity or transaction data.\n",

    "**Tool Usage:**\n",
    "- Use tools only when necessary to fulfill the user's request.\n",
